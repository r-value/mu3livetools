## Usage

This mod requires [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx). Make sure you have BepInEx properly installed for your MU3 game.

Extract the released archive to your `BepInEx/plugins` folder. You can download the latest archive [here](https://github.com/r-value/mu3livetools/releases/latest).

In OBS or other live streaming applications, add a Browser Source with URL of `http://localhost:9715/default.html`, width of 400px, height of 700px. Note that currently the web overlay is not designed for various width/height.

If you haven't started your game, please start the game first and refresh the browser source after that, so that the mod can display information normally.

Install font `FOT-Seurat ProN` for a more familiar look of music title with original game.

## Supported Game Versions

Currently supports version `1.50` only. Not tested on version `1.51`. Version `1.45` and below are NOT supported.

## Build from source

Put game assembly `Assembly-CSharp.dll` to `lib/` and use `dotnet build`

## Known issues

 * This mod may crash the game if you have malformed option data installed with missing music jackets.
 * This mod relies on specific scene sequences to synchronize state, and scene-skipping mods may cause it to malfunction.

[^1]:Per-chart T-Score Rating is based on **Technical Score** and achieved **Badge bonuses**. Refer [here](https://silentblue.remywiki.com/ONGEKI:Rating#Score_rating_(Re:Fresh)) for further definitions.

[^2]:Per-chart P-Score Rating is based on **Stars count**. Refer [here](https://silentblue.remywiki.com/ONGEKI:Rating#Star_rating_(Re:Fresh)) for further definitions.

[^3]:Minus style is a scoring method that starts from the highest score and deducts corresponding points for mistakes.
